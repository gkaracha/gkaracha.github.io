<h2><a name="about"></a>About me</h2>
<p align="justify">
  I am a software engineer and researcher working with
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweag.io/">Tweag</a>.
  My interests lie in the area of programming language design and
  implementation, with a strong focus on purely functional languages.
  Though I love all programming languages (maybe with the
  exception of <a target="_blank" href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP</a>),
  I have a tender spot in my heart for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.

    As an engineer, I spend most of my time working on
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tweag/asterius">Asterius</a>, the
    Haskell-to-WebAssembly compiler maintained by Tweag.

    As a researcher, I focus on the design and implementation of type inference
    and elaboration algorithms for advanced type systems.

  In my free time I enjoy reading literature, discovering music, carving
  smoking pipes, and hiking in nature with my partner and
  <a target=_blank" href="./images/dharma.jpg" alt="Dharma!">our adorable dog</a>;
  we love things that grow, so most of the time we surround ourselves with plants and trees!

<h3><a name="about"></a>Past Activities</h3>
<p align="justify">
  In 2018 I obtained my Ph.D. from
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/">KU Leuven</a>,
  where I worked with Prof.
  <a target="_blank" href="http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~tom.schrijvers/">Tom Schrijvers</a>
  on
  <a target="_blank" href="./papers/phd-thesis.pdf">extensions to type classes and pattern match checking</a>.
  After that, I continued working with Tom as a PostDoc, doing
  research on PL-related topics (type-and-effect systems, disjoint intersection types, ...),
  before finally joining Tweag with an aspiration to apply
  my knowledge to real-life problems.
  In the distant past I graduated from the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ece.ntua.gr">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>
  at the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html">National Technical University of Athens</a>,
  where I worked with Prof.
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/">Nikolaos Papaspyrou</a>
  on the exhaustiveness checking of pattern matching with GADTs.
